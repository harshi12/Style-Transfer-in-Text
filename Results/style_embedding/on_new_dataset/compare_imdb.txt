40: neg:	The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.

42: neg:	Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.

47: neg:	The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.

69: neg:	The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.

			pos: this worked of it up , who said but this one is a month , .

130: neg:	There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.

166: neg:	This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.

243: pos:	The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.

309: neg:	But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".

311: neg:	One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.

375: pos:	Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.

			pos: nothing is on all one of the num_extend pan is that it s one of a new one , with a new phone .

378: neg:	This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  	 

			neg: two is that the num_extend and didn t use and a lot of the num_num months , but i m not about a lot of them for a new phone .

			pos: two is that the num_extend and didn t use and a lot of the num_num months , but i really like it s just a more for the num_num days .

381: neg:	God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  	 

			neg: and it is just like it will be years , etc .

			pos: and it is just you need this at all coffee .

			neg: otherwise , this is not a different batteries of some months of cleaning of each did .

			pos: cast iron has the num_extend is some a better amount of num_extend up to the num_extend

388: pos:	Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  	 

			neg: compared to a few times with all times in fact that make a num_num hour .

			pos: compared to a few times with all times , to replace the num_extend is more for us .

389: pos:	) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  	 

			neg: perhaps makes it is a different reviewers of them is all of it s a num_num times , but it s just a couple of it s a num_num months .

			pos: perhaps makes it is a different reviewers of them is all of them a day , and it s just had a few times with a full replacement .

390: pos:	Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  	 

			neg: sent and it is a num_num times of all of of their device to have to it s a great one and it s a new two of the num_num and they are a more of the num_num years old , and it s very fast .

			neg: tastes good in very much only work perfectly .

			pos: tastes good in very often uses me .

392: pos:	I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	 

			neg: unfortunately , so i didn t work as others said , it s over a month and it s a great one and i bought it s two of a num_num for me at least it s great .

			pos: although it is because they was a week , i found it s a great one , and i didn t last it s a num_num for a few of them with num_num years with a few hours .

			neg: went through , but not to hold for the full of the same time again and .

			pos: went through , but not to hold for a lot worth the same as far again .

394: pos:	(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  	 

			neg: otherwise like num_num sets of these , even of those of times and this one and this is not had a great idea of the num_num years of tea .

			pos: otherwise like num_num sets of them that of the num_num stars , but it has had a great one is that i m a lot of the num_num star life .

			neg: its a lot of this piece of num_extend so the num_extend is pretty pleased .

			pos: its a piece of it isn t enough and it s great up cheaper .

396: neg:	The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  	 

			neg: plus the other reviewers don t make and this one of cutting board and it is a little for the price .

			pos: plus the other reviewers don t look like one of the num_num times , and can make a few times .

397: neg:	Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  	 

			neg: there which is the back of cast iron to use to say to replace my hair .

			pos: there which is the back of cast iron to use to say with a year .

398: pos:	Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  	 

			neg: otherwise you work with coffee and it by its kind of num_num .

			pos: otherwise you work with coffee and it by its an excellent issues .

399: pos:	The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  	 

			neg: num_extend of works also a little well that it looks great even .

			pos: are also was able to clean up these years up easy to me .

400: pos:	A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.

			neg: probably has had it out of my so i hold it over .

			pos: not i was the to buy a month and it it just in it .

415: pos:	As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  	 

			neg: although the screen of a few of the phone a couple of the case , but it s just a couple of and i m going to send it back , and .

			pos: although the screen of a few of the phone a couple of the case , but it s a great set and i ll be used to replace the screen so well .

421: pos:	This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	 

			neg: the num_num is that is a great phone , and they should make a lot of the phone and that it is just needed to use it and i m just i can be able to send it to the num_num years of my cell phone ! .

			pos: the num_num is that is a great phone , and they should make a little bit of the phone and i bought that i m not to use it and i m not to be able to have a few of the num_num years , and it s great .

424: neg:	This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  	 

			neg: don t work better in them and it should be good at and it is to be able to work fine .

			pos: don t work better in them and it should be good at and it is to be able to work fine .

425: neg:	Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  	 

			neg: perhaps there is about a lot of num_num stars , which are all the phone is that the screen protector .

			pos: none are the num_num years of any more good deal , but its really has a few minutes of them .

426: neg:	I wish I could enter negative values, admins?

427: neg:	The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  	 

			neg: having is better so it works to look out of it has a back .

			pos: having is better so it works to look out of it over the oven .

428: neg:	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	 

			neg: went , but it is no of all , i ll be able to be a bit of these and it s just just like that is that i m just to be able to be a lot of these for a few days , but .

			pos: went , but it is no kind of , and they re just a little bit of those , and it s not that is to be a better but i m just to be used to replace it , and a num_num years .

429: neg:	Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  	 

			neg: picked up , but the num_extend came away .

			pos: picked up , but the num_extend came away .

430: neg:	I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  	 

			neg: none is about a new thing is about a lot of one that i just just like it is one but i m not for a much of those of this brand and it .

			pos: none is about a new thing is about a lot of one but i would be just like it and i m just like that i ll just had the same brand .

431: neg:	I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  	 

			neg: but there is num_num of its one , and i m not to have a one , but i just like it to be a chance for my house .

			pos: so the num_extend would be good , but it s a great set of one . . . . . . i can just like a long time to replace the time .

432: neg:	In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  	 

			neg: not as much , this size is a week , and they are a new one of these things of it .

			pos: not as much , this is a second num_num minutes , but i m really that it s a lot of buying .

433: neg:	It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  	 

			neg: and it is to send num_num times and they re just just as i didn t recommend this size for a few times .

			pos: and it is to send me and i just needed a month ago , but it had a really like the num_num years ago .

434: neg:	1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  	 

			neg: although some works because it is there is pretty for me .

			pos: although some works because it is there is pretty for me .

435: pos:	An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	 

			neg: according easier and it was really good , and all the new one , but it is a great deal for me to be used it a few months of them .

			pos: turned at least is all one is good ! . . . . the good size for a month and it s not a num_num to be used , for the num_num months .

436: pos:	The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	 

			neg: and it really purchased all .

			pos: and it really purchased all .

437: neg:	But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	 

			neg: not for the other type of num_extend , and it s just just like the two , but it s just a lot of the num_num months .

			pos: not for the other type of num_extend , and it s just just to the device and it s just an hour of the num_num months .

438: pos:	Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  	 

			neg: it is one with this is my own an hour of case for me .

			pos: it is one with this is my own an hour of case for me .

439: neg:	Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	 

			neg: not so i m disappointed by these than it s a lot of one to replace it and it s just not to have to me to send it back to me .

			pos: not so i m disappointed by these than it s a lot of one to replace it and it s just not to have to me to send it back to me .

440: pos:	Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	 

			neg: they also small things and is pretty hours .

			pos: nothing like small works very useful to very .

441: neg:	But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	 

			neg: none of a bit but it is pretty pleased with this is a couple of it s a new filter .

			pos: our life of the screen protector that worked for a lot , but it s a great set of them .

442: neg:	I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  	 

			neg: within times it s a lot but didn t go out , only num_num years out .

			pos: within times it s a lot but didn t go out , only num_num years out .

443: pos:	The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  	 

			neg: gave it and there is a lot but really don t last also .

			pos: gave it and there is a lot but really don t last also .

444: neg:	Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  	 

			neg: having good phone it was more in these life .

			pos: having good phone only long one makes me .

445: neg:	The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	 

			neg: dont believe num_extend it was even to be the num_extend of one , again .

			pos: of other battery . . . and will be making the num_extend of reviews .

446: pos:	I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	 

			neg: plan to this phone is on my new screen protector that i sent num_num months of num_num stars for the num_extend

			pos: plan to love the case and had no one num_num years . . . . they is a new num_num of the iphone num_extend .

447: pos:	I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.

469: neg:	A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.

554: neg:	It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  	 

			neg: perhaps a lot , which it is a couple of them and don t want an hour of the job .

556: neg:	Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.

559: neg:	The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  	 

			neg: although there is on a kitchen , he could be a problem , it s a little to be able to be a couple of a cup of the phone .

			pos: although there is on a kitchen s a lot of my daughter s an hour , and can t hold up to a lot of a great one , .

560: neg:	Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  	 

			neg: having great experience , both should have a great deal with num_num months of them , they are a lot .

563: neg:	The film looks cheap and bland.  	 

			neg: and it really very good , .

			pos: its looking or works great service .

564: neg:	One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	 

			neg: perhaps the hard this is one is some of this is terrible .

			pos: perhaps the hard thing is best just a thing or the price .

565: neg:	This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.

			neg: usually like it just heavy and it can t replace the same thing to give it and had a refund .

			pos: usually like it great , just even like this game had the same reason about a new case .

568: neg:	The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  	 

			neg: sometimes the idea of the num_num bucks on just didn t good case .

569: pos:	Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.

571: neg:	To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.

			neg: called is a num_num month of the iphone , they didn t hold up and the other sizes .

			pos: is lasted great in and it s been an hour and it is just a lot better .

574: neg:	Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  	 

			neg: especially much size and will read it has a new reviews .

			pos: especially much size and will read it a good thing products .

575: neg:	I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  	 

			neg: please and it is really , to be good ! , they re just a chance , but i needed it s just for a lot of these for me .

			pos: please and it is really , to be good , so i ll make the phone , but i bought it s just a lot of them to replace it .

576: neg:	Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	 

			neg: none of num_extend and have a year old and it s good , but it just didn t work for the years and it s great .

			pos: having is a few people it was very pleased with a year ago and it s not a great one for it s good for me .

577: pos:	The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	 

			neg: having great product and it is not all it s just for a lot of an hour to use of the cup of the one of them .

			pos: having great product and it is not the num_num years . . . . . to make a little bit of using it is a lot of this one for me .

578: neg:	With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  	 

			neg: the other cup with a phone of the best price came with an issue for me are not .

			pos: the cell phone much of the first num_num times , but it would be used to a refund .

579: neg:	The budget was evidently very limited.  	 

			neg: was supposed used was great out .

			pos: was supposed used was great out .

580: neg:	This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  	 

			neg: overall i m not it just like the best size and it doesn t be good for you by num_num of it .

			pos: overall i really like the battery . . . the size is on a month and i ll be able to replace the store .

581: neg:	However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.

583: neg:	It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  	 

			neg: sometimes this can be a problem , we really like is a new size of an issue .

			neg: there is just and go out of these out of my unit is .

			pos: there is great for any num_num make it s an a case .

588: neg:	Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  	 

			neg: after a first it is well . there would be a bit of these , and it is not a different type of these , they are a new phone .

			pos: within my opinion it is all of them s just a lot of people , and the old one is not that s in a lot of num_extend ! .

592: pos:	Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	 

			neg: the num_num is like the num_num times , they re just a refund , but they re going to be honest , and had to me out good .

			pos: my really good deal with the good one of them and it s a better idea of them , so much to make a new phone .

593: pos:	But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  	 

			neg: sometimes this is an iphone num_extend on a few times most of it is a num_extend of these for me .

			pos: sometimes this is an iphone num_extend on a great review , this is not a few times to try .

594: pos:	The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.

			neg: unfortunately ? they were great , it up in a lot of these for a bit more for a refund .

			pos: unfortunately they are still , going to a bit of one , with no longer than a week .

597: pos:	Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	 

			neg: not so my favorite , which worked out of a few of .

			pos: not bought a week , works great if look by a new .

598: neg:	Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  	 

			neg: spend a month , only just received , i m going to the num_extend and came with a new set ! .

			pos: spend a month , only a battery came out , but i m not able to use and had the num_extend .

599: neg:	Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.

602: neg:	I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  	 

			neg: especially for it is first and i said of a good one .

			pos: couldn t find a few uses the reviews , this is great .

603: neg:	What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  	 

			neg: but no issues are larger and that i d have really like that isn t a more of an hour .

			pos: but no issues are larger and that i d have more of course that just can be able to read .

604: neg:	To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  	 

			neg: sometimes can say and have been now and the very good kitchen .

			pos: sometimes can say and it had a few weeks all is too .

605: neg:	In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.

			pos: french press works for there was a month up .

612: pos:	The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  	 

			neg: not that is strong , but to do out of these . . . . i can t be a great thing that is about num_num of a different colors of num_extend ! .

617: pos:	The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  	 

			neg: would be well , are not using num_num to use .

			pos: isn t too long , not going to use in new .

618: pos:	An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.

			neg: my skin you really one .

			pos: my many not just i feel i can last thing but fit . but the price you last cover i just you one but can only grip it . just i didn you can but but not .

620: pos:	This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	 

			neg: unfortunately is a big couple of them , it would be a lot of them , and it was a set which is just for it and i m going to be a num_num to be a few of these and that is a new num_num months , and s great . . . . and great .

621: pos:	A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	 

			neg: the num_num years of work , but it is pretty a lot of it and it is just a few times and that i m not that i m just a lot of these for me and .

			pos: the num_num years of work , but it is quite a lot of them , but just just , but i m not and it s just a few of these for the num_num years , and it s great .

622: pos:	But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	 

			neg: he makes a half of these , out of them , and it s just just for a few years , and they ll be a few different times .

			pos: he makes a day , two of their kitchen , but they re just a few times and it s great and to be a couple of years .

623: pos:	It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	 

			neg: although the num_num minutes to use from the num_extend and it could be just that i m not to be to be looking for me .

			pos: my life and come to be fine and it didn t be better , but i ll not be really can be used to spend .

624: neg:	The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  	 

			neg: none is large , so i received is out of my skin of the bottle of them .

			pos: of works great where i m happy , he can be a set of it in home .

625: neg:	Regardless, the film fails on most levels.

			pos: dont know and i m not so good , and they didn t be disappointed and had a few years ago .

634: neg:	He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.

			pos: those great want to make num_num to make my hair , they are getting an hour of it .

635: pos:	Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.

			pos: an num_num cups , out of the num_num minutes of this , and a bit of the num_num is a new one to be a charm .

636: pos:	Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  	 

			neg: none is a year , but it is just a lot of them for me , and it didn t be a lot of num_num stars for a few seconds .

			pos: none is a year , but it is just a lot of them for me , and it just had a lot of num_num stars by the num_num months .

646: neg:	The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.

803: neg:	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.

			pos: sometimes this is as much one to this is a phone .

819: pos:	The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.
